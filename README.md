#Getting Started:#
Download this repo's source and commit/check-in your work as you progress via your own github account within a new public repo.

The questions can be answered within the appropriate file. (I.e. Question 1 can be answered in the file: question_1.php) unless otherwise stated in the question.

Each file will contain further instructions on where to insert your code.

#Question 1:#
Given a MySQL database with the following tables:

```mysql
CREATE TABLE `customer` (
  `customer_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `last_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `customer_occupation_id` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`customer_id`)
)

CREATE TABLE `customer_occupation` (
  `customer_occupation_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `occupation_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `salary` INT(7) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`customer_occupation_id`)
)
```

Modify the file question_1.php to show the list of all customers from the table `customer` together with their occupations from the `customer_occupation` table in the MySQL database to display on a web page.

A database connection will need to be created

If the customer does not have a matching occupation, please list them as 'un-employed'

Finally, include an optional GET parameter named `occupation_name` which can be accepted from the user to filter and display any customers with a matching occupation_name

I.e: A request such as: /question_1.php?occupation_name=Manager will display all customers with an occupation of: "Manager"

#Question 2:#
There are 3 types of customers:
* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold

Whenever a deposit is made:
* Bronze customers do not receive any extra credits
* Silver customers get 5% extra credit added their account balance (e.g. depositing $100 gives them $105)
* Gold customers get 10% extra credit added to their account balance (e.g. depositing $100 gives them $110)

Using question_2.php, create sub-classes of the Customer class for the 3 customer types - Bronze_Customer, Silver_Customer, and Gold_Customer

Create the deposit method(s) called `deposit()` that takes the deposit amount as its argument and increments the $balance of the object by the deposit amount PLUS the extra credit (if any)

#Question 3:#
The first character of the customer IDs represents the customer type:
* *B* for Bronze
* *S* for Silver
* *G* for Gold

The customer ID is then followed by a set of numbers (no longer than 10 characters total).

So a customer with customer ID: 'B2345' is a Bronze customer, 'S5678' is a Silver customer, and 'G1234' is a Gold customer.

Use your file question_2.php and create a factory method called 'get_instance()' to instantiate the correct object (Gold, Silver or Bronze
customer) given a customer ID described above.

When an invalid customer ID is passed to the factory method, make it throw an InvalidArgument exception

#Question 4:#
When a new customer is created, a unique username needs to be generated for the customer.

As per the requirements around customer IDs outlined in **Question 3** the customer's username needs to begin with a specified character as follows:
* *B* for Bronze
* *S* for Silver
* *G* for Gold

The **username** is then followed by a set of alphanumeric characters (no longer than 30 characters total). It cannot contain any special characters or spaces.

For example, a Bronze customer may have the following generated username: B2b6483600ewq6

Utilize the customer class(es) you have setup in question_2.php and add any required additional methods/members to these classes where appropriate in order to provide method(s) called `generate_username()`
which will generate and return a valid username as a string
